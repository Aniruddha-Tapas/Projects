Best Buy ever
This is one of the best things I have bought online.

Pros : If you are already a MAC user, I dont need to spell it out for you . If you have never used a mac, believe me this is the the time to get it [unless you are rich or stupid]. At this price it a steal. This thing costs upwards of 66,000 on amazon US website (Apple product cheaper in India than US - WOW).
Being an Apple product, how are they selling it for so less is a mystery. It cost me around 54,000 rs. after applying the promo code of chromecast (which is another great device to have - Imagine the capability to stream anything on your TV from your cellphone). As of now the offer has been removed, but the MBP still is a great buy. 
Artistic design, snappy response, backlit keyboard, long battery life. Hard to find fault. Screen resolution could have been better(But every display can be better if you compare it to retina display so I'm not complaining). The ones who have always been on windows might need a couple of days to adjust and it is not that steep a learning curve either. Whatever you have been doing in windows will get better by quite a margin.
Also MACs, unlike iphones dont lose their relevance as soon the next model comes out. I have already upgraded this thing to OS Yosemite (Apple doesnt charge for OS updates) and it will continue to get updates for forseeable future. OS Yosemite is available to MBPs as old as 2009.  Also it is hard to get bored of it. If you intend to buy a a laptop, buy this without without a second thought.

CONS: I find it to be a little on the heavier side, but that will happen when you replace cheap plastic with aluminium. Delhivery courier services as usual with its deficient delivery took 7 days, but there was an extented weekend in between.

My advice : Get a case for it, the istore technicians are really jerks if you try to redeem warranty after putting a dent in it.

Awesome product from apple.
This is my first apple device and I am already in love with it. 
PROS: The processor is awesome. Sound quality is superb. Pre-installed apps are very good. Keypad is awesome. And its trackpad is something which only apple can provide you. Battery backup is of 7 hours which is awesome. DIsplay is no less.
Buying a laptop was difficult for me as in this price range, there were many others which were giving much more. But if you are an apple lover, you will love this product. 
And if you are not, then there are some things which may bother you like its graphic processor is only only 1GB, storage capacity is 500GB.
But from my point of view, this is the best product one can have in this price range. It is very much compatible and only weighs 2.01kg. And at last, apple is apple.

Buy this instead of a Windows laptop.
1. Best Mac to buy if graphic intensive tasks arent your priority.
2. Best part of this MacBook is that it is upgradable unlike the new ones. You can increase the RAM to 16GB, the optical drive can be replaced with another HDD or SSD.
3. Mac can run windows, in case you need it and can run it better than most Windows laptops out there.
4. Comes with OS X Yosemite and is upgradable to El Capitan. Manufacturing date is generally second in the  half of 2015. OS is very smooth and shows no lag.
5. 4GB RAM is not a problem, the MacBook runs really well.
6. Most important software like Pages, Keynote, numbers, iMovie, Garage Band come pre-installed.
7.Trackpad  is a joy to use.
8. All the important software that we use on Windows are available for Mac too - Be it programming tools or office tools.
9. Open-source Libre office is also available for Mac, so I would say there is no need to buy office, in case you do not like iWorks.
10. Although the display is not retina but it is very good and you would not have to complain.
11. Buid quality is supreme. Full Aluminum.
12. Have not heard the Fan noise in my 1 month of use.

Hope this Helps. Go for it.

Apple + Snapdeal's Low Price = Happiness
Buying a MacBook Pro was the best decision I would have ever made. The Performance and Battery Back-up are Awesome. Apple mentions the battery back-up to be 7hours, so on Day I started using it I saw Time remaining on battery was showing 3.48hours. Now if you see this dont panic, basically what Mac OS does is, it shows the time the Battery will sustain on the current level of consumption of laptop. For Example, if you are using 4-5 heavy Applications at a time the Time-Remaining will show-up less, But as soon as you quit few Applications gradually the Time-Remaining will show-up more value.
Well, many people also advised me to return this back and order new MacBook Air. But to be frank I am ok with the of HDD and I don't need SSD, moreover MacBook Air has 128 GB SSD in this same price, while the MacBook Pro has 500GB which is respectable amount of space atleast as per my requirement.

Cons:
Heavy, Speakers are not much loud but fantastic Apple Experience if you are using headphones.

CLOSE YOUR EYES AND CLICK ON 'BUY NOW'

Simply the Best!!!
Hi All 

this is my first Laptop purchase. this is my first Mac. i'm just in love with it. 

there is no better experience than Mac for a laptop user. 

if you have been using windows till now...and if this is first mac experience..you will never go back to windows again...

no need to tell about the pros of buying. some cons of buying this are...
1. its a bit heavy compared to other laptops in the same segment. you would expect a lighter version . 
2. it is having 4 gb ram. it might not be as fast as u think it would be. 
3. its costly. have to pay the price for its awesomeness.

Nov 07, 2014







Good Product.
This is a product worth its price. The MacBookPro is a 13 inch Mid 2012 model which comes with Mac OS X,  2.5 GHz Intel Core i5 Processor , 500 GB hard drive,  1,280-by-800 resolution display,Memory: 4 GB 1600 MHz DDR3,  one Thunderbolt  port, two USB 3.0 ports, a FireWire 800 port, Graphics : Intel HD Graphics 4000, SD card reader. The MacBook Pro has useful DVD drive, Gigabit Ethernet port,  Outside battery power indicator (which works even when the Mac is  shut down), Sleep indicator, remote compatibility, these features are now absent in new Macs. The product is original and a good buy.

Mar 22, 2015







A Perfect Lappy at this Price
Look out of the  "Window" and experience the wonderland of "Macworld" at amazingly cheap price.Using it from last 4-5 months. no problem so far. As a conventional user of Window OS from last 20 years, still i m in process of exploring the Mac OS &  got amazed by some of it unseen features.

Why should you go for it.
1. Battery back up is approx 8-9hrs (though they say it is up to 7 hrs only)
2. Bright Backlit Keyboard
3. Crisp Display (U will get better experience than Full HD laptops)
4. Solid Built Quality

Last Upgradable Macbook
I had a choice between Retina Pro and this 13 inch Pro.. I decided to go with this 13 inch as it allows me the freedom to upgrade the RAM up-to 16 GB and SSD.. The performance is second to none but would suggest you upgrade the RAM after buying as 4gb is very less in todays age. If you have to decide between Windows and MAC offcorse always choose MAC though its expensive but it pays back as 5 year old mac compares favorably in performance with a 3 year old Windows machine due to tight integration between OS and hardware.

Apr 16, 2015







best value for money mac
This Mac ... the MD101 is the perfect Mac. It is a model which supports all the features in the latest OSX version. Like handoff, airdrop, airplay etc.
This makes it great value for money.
Also this is the last Macbook that supports a DVD/CD drive for all us holding onto CDs and the ones who watch movies on a laptop ... this is priceless.
The only wish that I had for this macbook was for it to have a retina display. But then again ... one can always pay more and get one.
For this price I think this macbook delivers more than you can ask for.

Awesome Product And  Great Service by Snapdeal !!
This is my first apple device and after using it for a week I'm very much happy and satisfied with this product. Apart from its looks and specs I'm impressed with its process management. OSX Yosemite is superb. 
 As per the performance it is performing brilliantly and I can say way better than a windows PC. I have been using windows for last 6-7 years and now I have shifted to Mac. All I can say I am more than satisfied and planning to stay in mac environment forever.
The product is seriously awesome and so sleek that you will never feel the weight :)
Got it delivered within two days after placing the order with great packaging so i m very happy from snapdeal service.

Simply Awesome!!
So here's my review of my first apple macbook. First the customer service of Snapdeal is really good. The packaging of the product was good and was delivered within 2 days. As for the product, its not a retina display model, but still the display is far better than other laptops available. The trackpad and keyboard are amazing to work with and its always a pleasure to work on Mac. The keys are widely separated from each other which makes typing very easy. The processor speed is decent enough.

Overall, the Macbook pro is a delight to use and would recommend it to anyone who wants to buy this!!

Apple MacBook Pro (MD101HNA)
Apple MacBook Pro (MD101HNA) (3rd Gen Intel Core i5- 4GB RAM- 500GB HDD-33.78 cms (13.3) Screen- Mac OS X Lion) (Silver) I had good experience. i would recommend the same those who are interested to buy.

Sep 08, 2015







Awesome Product
I have been looking this laptop to buy for a long time. Finally decided and booked over snapdeal.
Snapdeal gave me good deal with discount. It delivered on time at the exact same day of estimated delivery. Packing was really too good of snapdeal.
This is really soo beautiful Laptop. Its very easy to work on MAC than the windows now-a-days. Within couple of minutes I could register my Laptop to on-line Apple for 1 year warranty support.
their is only one lack, I could observe, it takes bit longer time than to its predecessor MAC laptop to boot. Anyway this is very miner.

I would recommend this laptop to those who are looking for robust product which runs longer and is stable

Thanks again

Apple MacBook Pro.....One of the best laptops in the market today.
Am a hardcore Apple user for over 15 years now. My first apple product being the Apple eMac G4 which is still going strong. As far as I am concerned the apple computers are the best personal computers, though seem a little expensive to acquire but in the long run are absolute "Value For Money". The current purchase has been done keeping in mind the product utility and longevity. The biggest advantage being that the OS comes preloaded and most software easily available and are updated free of cost.

Oct 08, 2015







Awesome
This is genuine Apple product, the very best. Though it is an old model but the specification is absolutely fine and good for daily life use. The brand is as awesome as it delivers. I have not a single problem yet so far with this product. Battery life, processor evrythng is amazing!!!

Jun 11, 2015







Best Laptop
Best screen,best sound,best battery backup. Overall good experience.

Nov 20, 2014







Original Product of Premium Quality
Anyone who must be here to buy the product would already know about what a macbook is about.

So basically this product is very good and better battery backup than any other windows pc laptop of this calibre.This gives a total 6 hours of Run from 100% to 0% battery.

Great performance,hardly experienced anylag even on cpu expensive work.

The only bad thing is about the delivery service.If you have this coming from Delhivery courier then know that it is the worst courier service you can ever get.I received my product after 12 days or more after it touring half India.

So snapdeal should cancel Delhivery delivery service from their services.They are no good.and this is the only reason i deducted one star.

Awesone product at an unbelieveable price !!!!
I got this Macbook pro from Snapdeal.

1st of all i was amazed with the delivery as it was delivered in just 2 days.

2nd reason was the big discount i got.

Macbook pro is very powerful, easy to use and the config is most recent, enough for personal use and also for official purpose.

the only downside i feel is the battery life if you compare it with Macbook Air.

Other than that it is next to perfect.

Mar 04, 2015







my first laptop and best laptop i got
much better than the window no lag better screen  battery life and good processor  speed i just love it

Jan 17, 2015







It's flawless!!
The MacBook comes with OS X Mavericks (contrary to Mountain Lion specified here). Delivered on time in a very good condition. I loved the packaging. If you're a first time Mac user, things might annoy you at first but you'll fall in love with the product very shortly. The keyboard is backlit, LED screen is awesome. Definitely go for the product. It's worth more than what you'll be spending!!

Outdated but delivers Apple experience
Upgraded the OS for amazing experience -> Internet browsing is secure, with iOS 8 on my iPad it delivers more efficient working, options of running Microsoft Office as well as bootcamp for Windows OS looks good. It's all about engineering!!

Drawbacks->Adobe windows licenses became unusable. New Retina display looks better but comes with price. Heavier then I thought. Some websites are not safari friendly so one has to use alternate browser

Awesome Product.
It has been about 4 months I have been using this product and without a doubt in mind, I can assure you all that this is the best thing that I have ever brought. No lags, no issues, performance is just perfect. And the best part is the speakers. you cannot find anything else that sounds so good at such a price.

Oct 14, 2014







Rightful Invest
This is my first Apple product and i liked it very much. It funtionality are awesome and i am thrilled to use it. 
I was bit skeptical about Snapdeal service but they delivered me in the given duration but i would request snapdeal to expedite their service.
Pros:: Good Speaker and the machine is fater and don't lag as compared to other windows machine. 
Cons: I didn't found yet.
       but i like to add the point to Snapdeal to deliver it ASAP.

Nov 25, 2014

It is one of the best laptops available. Got it on the savings day. Although snapdeal has a bad courier partner ( ecom express ) . Otherwise the product quality doesnot get any better. Fast, 500gb ssd hdd. It is a bomb in small price.

Love it.
I moved to Mac with this laptop. You won't miss Windows for sure. Comes with El Capitan inbuilt. Amazing design, fast, lovely screen, good apps (its apple) and simple.

Apple MacBook Pro (MD101HNA)
This was my first online purchasing experience and I am happy that, I have chosen snap deal for it.  Overall it was nice experience !

May 15, 2015







dont judge a laptop by its weight :-)
though it is heavier than mac book air but performance wise it is any day much better and faster than air. totally worth being heavier. 

if anyone does not need fast machine for office purpose but only for personal, facebook, chat, emails, etc then one may go for mac air otherwise this is the machine.

macbook wa
Takes some time to get use to- very good trackpad, get a wireless mouse for the learning curve. Had to pay for MS Office,  Infact Numbers is quite efficient once u get the knack

Good choice, perfect price, unmatched quality
The laptop was perfect, month of mfg was September 2015 which was very good indeed, liked everything about the seller and the information given about the product. I think it superseded my expectations as I was initially hesitant on buying such an expensive product online without seeing it, but snapdeal has lived up to my expectations. The price was unmatched and the best available at that point.

Its very nice deal with snapdeal.

Go for it if your budget is limited.

Perfect. It doesn't get any better
Great price and super quick shipping. Received my order in 3 business days and the product is EXACTLY as described. Brand new, sealed in the original Box. Only discrepancy was that the description said it would come with MAC OS X Lion but it was actually preloaded with MAC OS X Yosemite.

SHIFTING TO MAC FROM WINDOWS - A SMOOTH
SHIFTING FROM A WINDOWS LAPTOP TO A MAC HAS BEEN A GREAT EXPERIENCE WITH MACBOOK PRO . GOING IN FOR THIS MODEL WITH DVD WAS A LOGICAL CHOICE AS I STILL HAVE A GOOD DVD COLLECTION WHICH HAS STILL NOT BEEN SAVED ON HARD DRIVE.
NONE OF THE APPLICATIONS HANG LIKE IN WINDOWS.
ONLY ISSUE I HAVE IS WITH THE IPHOTO LIBRARY WHICH DOES NOT SEEM TO SHOW ALL THE THUMBNAILS

No need to judge Apple!!
It is fantastic, its colour,its design and its specs are all undoubtedly fabulous. It was delivered in no time before the actual date.

Amazing laptop. After using Mac you cannot use any other laptop for sure. Though the delivery was delayed by snapdeal (took 12 days after booking) and minor problems from snapdeal with product purchase date (purchase date was prior to booking date) I am very much satisfied with my laptop.

Best laptop ever. Have been using for last 1year with no memory issue or any such problems.

Awesome Macbook Pro
Steal Deal At Snap Deal.
A Great machine for a great price. the last of apple macbooks with an inbuilt DVD drive.
Saves on buying peripherals.
 Some one will say that the specs are a bit outdated , but you are not using this to develop rocket science.
A value for money apple at a steal price.

Right product. Good service. Amazing deal!
Increasing the trust quotient, I have purchased this product from snapdeal with great service. The same product is available in market at 6k higher price, and snapdeal provides the greatest deal on it. The packaging is very good. The delivery, however was a bit late (5-6 days), but still manageable since the price fluctuations were high in online retail.

Good but not the best.
It's good, but it's heavy, and feels very outdated. If you can afford the Macbook Retina Pro, buy that, or if you don't need to do much heavy work, go for the Macbook Air.

Average, Ordinary
The Apple Macbook PRO Delivered is New and Original.There was 1 day delay than the promised date but somehow snapdeal delivered the product next day even during the festival time.The Packing of the product could have been much better.The 3 star rating is given because Im yet to get any updates on my old laptop buyback after 20 days of purchase.
