    "We'll do face and eye detection with OpenCV using Haar Cascades. In order to do object recognition/detection with cascade files, you first need cascade files. For the extremely popular tasks, these already exist. Detecting things like faces, eyes, smiles, cars, and license plates for example are all pretty popular and Haar Cascades of these are readily available.\n",

    "You can find such popular cascade files from https://github.com/Itseez/opencv/tree/master/data/haarcascades \n",
    "\n",
    "You can also use Google to find various Haar Cascades of things you may want to detect. We will use a Face cascade and Eye cascade. You can find a few more at the root directory of Haar cascades. Note the license for using/distributing these Haar Cascades.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we are doing face and eye detection, and thus we need face and eye haar cascade files.\n",
