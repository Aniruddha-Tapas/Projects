	/**
	 * Vertex coloring is the most common problem.
	 * 	- The problem is, given m colors, find a way of coloring the vertices of a graph such that no two adjacent vertices are colored using same color
	 *  - CHROMATIC NUMBER: The smallest number of colors needed to color a graph G is called its chromatic number
	 *  - The problem to find chromatic number of a given graph is NP Complete
	 *  
	 *  	Several applications:
	 *  		
	 *  		1.) Making schedules // time tables
	 *  
	 *  				Suppose we want to make am exam schedule for a university. We have list different subjects and students enrolled in 
	 *  		    	every subject. Many subjects would have common students (of same batch, some backlog students, etc). How do we schedule
	 *  	        	the exam so that no two exams with a common student are scheduled at same time? How many minimum time slots are needed to
	 *  		    	schedule all exams? This problem can be represented as a graph where every vertex is a subject and an edge between two vertices
	 *  		    	mean there is a common student. So this is a graph coloring problem where minimum number of time slots is equal to the chromatic
	 *  		    	number of the graph.
	 *  
	 *  		2.) Mobile Radio Frequency Assignment
	 *  
	 *  			 	When frequencies are assigned to towers, frequencies assigned to all towers at the same location must be different. How
	 *  			    to assign frequencies with this constraint? What is the minimum number of frequencies needed? This problem is also an 
	 *  				instance of graph coloring problem where every tower represents a vertex and an edge between two towers represents 
	 *  				that they are in range of each other
	 *  
	 *  		3.) Map coloring 
	 *  
	 *  				Geographical maps of countries or states where no two adjacent cities cannot be assigned same color.
	 *  				Four colors are sufficient to color any map
	 *  
	 *  		4.) Register Allocation
	 *  
	 *  				In compiler optimization, register allocation is the process of assigning a large number of target program
	 *  				variables onto a small number of CPU registers. This problem is also a graph coloring problem
	 * 
	 * 	Here we implement the greedy algorithm: d+1 colort hasznal max -> d a legtobb fogszammal rendelkezo vertex eleinek szama
	 * 			 It doesn’t guarantee to use minimum colors, but it guarantees an upper bound on the number of colors !!!
